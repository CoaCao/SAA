    2. Your organization already had a VPC(10.10.0.0/16) setup with one public(10.10.1.0/24) and two private subnets – private subnet 1 (10.10.2.0/24) and private subnet 2 (10.10.3.0/24). The public subnet has the main route table and two private subnets have two different route tables respectively.

    One of the private subnet route table’s local route has been changed to restrict access only within the subnet IP range.

    <i> For Option A, for any route table, the local route cannot be edited or deleted.<br>AWS Docs says:<br><br> <br><br>"Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC over IPv4. If your VPC has more than one IPv4 CIDR block, your route tables contain a local route for each IPv4 CIDR block.

You cannot modify or delete these routes."<br> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#RouteTables<br> <br>For Option B, possible because security group is configured with public subnet IP range instead of private subnet 1 IP range and EC2 is in private subnet 1.

    4. You are an architect in your organization. Your organization would want to upload files to AWS S3 bucket privately through AWS VPC. In an existing VPC, you created a subnet and VPC endpoint for S3. You also created one route table which routes the traffic from the subnet to a NAT gateway and also the traffic to S3 through the internet via the NAT gateway. But in AWS S3 server logs, you noticed that the request to S3 bucket from an EC2 instance is not coming via the Internet through the NAT Gateway. What could be causing this situation?

    When NAT Gateway and VPC endpoint exist on same route table, NAT Gateway always takes precedence.
    <br>
    <i>Option A, the opposite is true. VPC Endpoint always takes precedence over NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway. In the absence of VPC endpoint, requests to S3 are routed to NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway based on their existence in route table.<br><br><br>Option B, the elastic IP address is IPv4 public address with which you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.<br> <br><br>Elastic Ips are not used for routing requests from an EC2 instance.<br><br> <br><br>Option C, A NAT gateway cannot send traffic over VPC endpoints, AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering connections. If your instances in the private subnet must access resources over a VPC endpoint, a Site-to-Site VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect, use the private subnet’s route table to route the traffic directly to these devices and also add a route to the S3 VPC Endpoint.<br> <br><br>Please refer to the following link<br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html<br> <br><br>Option D is false. VPC Endpoint helps to route traffic internally within AWS network without the need to go over through internet. This makes your S3 bucket private to your network. For more information, refer VPC endpoint documentation<br>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-endpoint-for-amazon-s3/<br> <br><br>Note:<br><br>As per AWS,<br>S3 VPC endpoints doesn't support cross region requests.<br>When you create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, any requests to an Amazon S3 endpoint within the Region (for example, s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com) are routed to a private Amazon S3 endpoint within the Amazon network. You don't need to modify your applications running on EC2 instances in your VPC—the endpoint name remains the same, but the route to Amazon S3 stays entirely within the Amazon network, and does not access the public internet.<br><br>For more information please refer:<br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/vpc-endpoints-s3.html</i>

    <b>VPC endpoint contains a policy, currently restricted to certain S3 buckets and does not contain new S3 bucket.

    <i>Option A is correct, VPC endpoint has a policy which by default allows all actions on all S3 bucket. We can restrict access to certain S3 buckets and certain actions on this policy. In such cases, for accessing any new buckets or for any new actions, VPC endpoint policy needs to be modified accordingly.<br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-endpoints-access.html#vpc- endpoint-policies<br> <br>Option B is correct, AWS IAM role/user which is used to access S3 bucket need to have access granted via IAM policy before accessing. So if the IAM role/user is not an administrator or not having full S3 access, newly created S3 bucket must be added to the IAM policy.<br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html<br> <br>Option C is incorrect, by default there is no resource policy on S3 bucket. If we would like to make the bucket private, we can add a new resource policy with “Deny”. Please see the documentation for more information<br>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-create-a-policy-that-whitelists-access-to- sensitive-amazon-s3-buckets/<br> <br>Option D is incorrect, You can have multiple endpoint routes to different services in a route table, and you can have multiple endpoint routes to the same service in different route tables, but you cannot have multiple endpoints to the same service in a single route table. For example, if you have two endpoints to Amazon S3 in your VPC, you cannot use the same route table for both endpoints.<br>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-gateway.html#vpc-endpoints-limitations</i>
